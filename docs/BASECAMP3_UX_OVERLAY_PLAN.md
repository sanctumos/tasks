# Basecamp 3–style optional UI overlay — research and plan

**Project:** Sanctum Tasks (`sanctumos/sanctum-tasks`)  
**Author:** Otto (planning doc; CC BY-SA 4.0 per repo `LICENSE-DOCS`)  
**Date:** 2026-05-02  

> **2026-05-04 update:** Net-new Basecamp-shaped work should follow **[BASECAMP3_DOMAIN_PLAN.md](BASECAMP3_DOMAIN_PLAN.md)** (domain-first phases). The BC UI experiment was rolled back on `main`; **§6–7 milestones below are overlay-first**—keep §2–5 gap analysis and references, but use the domain plan for implementation sequencing.

This document satisfies three requests: (1) inventory and sync state for Sanctum OS repositories in this workspace, (2) a structured survey of **Basecamp 3** product surfaces and API concepts, (3) a gap analysis between **Sanctum Tasks** data and that archetype, plus a phased plan for an **optional, user-toggleable UI/UX overlay** without abandoning the current bare-bones admin.

---

## 1. Workspace synchronization (Sanctum OS → local)

**Canonical task product repo:** `https://github.com/sanctumos/sanctum-tasks.git`

| Path | Role | Sync performed (2026-05-02) |
|------|------|------------------------------|
| `/root/projects/sanctum-tasks` | Primary working copy for this plan | `git fetch` + `git pull --ff-only origin main` — **already up to date** |
| `/root/projects/sanctumos/sanctum-tasks` | Mirror under `sanctumos/` tree | Same — **already up to date** |
| `/root/projects/sanctum/sanctum-tasks` | Additional mirror under `sanctum/` | Same — **already up to date** |
| `/root/projects/sanctumos/*` (broca, smcp, sanctum-router, etc.) | Separate git roots; not a monorepo | Example: `broca`, `sanctum-tasks` pulled — **up to date** |

**Note:** There is **no** single `.git` at `/root/projects/sanctumos`; the organization is represented as **many sibling repositories**. For **this** product only, use `tools/sync-sanctum-tasks-clones.sh` (optionally set `SANCTUM_TASKS_MIRROR_PATHS` to space-separated extra clone directories). Org-wide multi-repo sync remains a workspace-level concern if you want one manifest for all `sanctumos/*` checkouts.

**Related but distinct:** Broca (`sanctumos/broca`) uses SQLite `messages` / `queue` for agent traffic — not the same domain as task **work items**, though product UX might someday link “notifications” to Broca; this plan does not assume that coupling.

---

## 2. Basecamp 3 — screens and capabilities (product surface)

Sources: Basecamp marketing/features copy, Basecamp 3 Help Center articles (e.g. home screen, project tools intro), and the public **Basecamp API** documentation (`github.com/basecamp/bc3-api` README and section index). Basecamp’s UI naming and API naming align loosely (“Todos”, “Message Board”, etc.).

### 2.1 Account-level / cross-project

| Area | User-facing purpose |
|------|---------------------|
| **Home** | Pinned projects, stacks, recent projects, optional colors/logos; **Your Schedule** (mini calendar + link to full schedule); **Your Assignments** (up next, due soon, complete inline). |
| **Project directory** | List all projects with filters (active, pinned, client, all-access, archived, deleted) + search on title/description. |
| **Jump menu** | Quick navigation (⌘/Ctrl+J) across projects, people, pages. |
| **Hey! / notifications** | Aggregated notification stream (distinct from email). |
| **Pings** | Direct / small-group chat outside a project. |
| **Lineup** | Visual timeline across projects. |
| **Mission Control / Hill Charts / activity-style reports** | Portfolio-level visibility (progress, workload, “what’s actually happening”). |
| **My assignments** (API) | Consolidated assigned work. |
| **My notifications** (API) | Machine-facing counterpart to Hey! |
| **Search** (API) | Global search across recordings. |
| **People** | Directory of people; per-project membership. |
| **Templates** | Create projects from templates. |

### 2.2 Inside a project (“dock” tools)

The API models each project as having a **dock**: enabled tools such as:

| Tool (typical `name`) | Primary UX |
|----------------------|------------|
| `message_board` | Threaded announcements / discussions (**messages**). |
| `chat` (Campfire) | Real-time project chat. |
| `todoset` → **todolists** → **todos** | Hierarchical to-dos; groups optional (**todolist_groups**). |
| `kanban_board` | **Card tables**: columns, cards, steps. |
| `schedule` | Calendar **schedule entries**. |
| `questionnaire` | Automatic check-ins (**questions**, **answers**). |
| `vault` | **Docs & files** (documents, uploads, folders). |
| `inbox` | Email **forwards**. |
| **Doors** | Links out to external tools (Figma, Google Docs, etc.). |
| **Client visibility / approvals / correspondences** | Client-facing controls where enabled. |
| **Boosts**, **Drafts**, **Trash/archive** | Engagement, composition lifecycle, recovery. |
| **Hill charts**, **Gauges**, **Timesheets**, **Reports** | Progress and operational reporting. |
| **Webhooks**, **Events** | Integration and activity streams. |

This is intentionally broad: a “Basecamp 3 clone” is a **multi-surface collaboration suite**. Sanctum Tasks today is intentionally narrower (tasks + comments + attachments + watchers).

---

## 3. Basecamp API — data archetype (what “full BC3” implies)

From `bc3-api` “Key concepts”:

- **Account** contains **projects**; each project has a **bucket** ID equal to the project.
- **Recordings** unify most content types with `status` (`active` / `archived` / `trashed`), tree structure, visibility, subscriptions — dozens of **types** (`Todo`, `Message`, `Schedule::Entry`, etc.).
- **Dock** describes which tools exist and their URLs/IDs.
- **Todos** live under **todolists** under a **todoset**; completion is `completed`, distinct from recording `status`.
- **Assignees** are arrays of person IDs (`assignee_ids`).
- Rich text is **HTML** for many resources; comments attach to **recordings** broadly.

**Implication:** Replicating Basecamp’s *data* model inside SQLite is a **large normalization exercise** (polymorphic “recording” or typed tables per resource). The overlay UX can still be valuable if it maps **only** the subset Sanctum supports, while the schema evolves in phases.

---

## 4. Sanctum Tasks today — screens and capabilities

### 4.1 Admin UI (`public/admin/`)

| Screen | File | Capability |
|--------|------|------------|
| Task list + filters | `index.php` | Filter by status, assignee, priority, project, search; sort; link to CRUD. |
| Task detail | `view.php` | Single task view. |
| Create / update / delete | `create.php`, `update.php`, `delete.php` | Standard CRUD. |
| Auth | `login.php`, `logout.php`, `change-password.php`, `mfa.php` | Session auth, MFA. |
| Users | `users.php` | User lifecycle. |
| API keys | `api-keys.php` | Integration keys. |

**Public home:** `public/index.php` (marketing / entry).  

**Styling:** Bootstrap 5, dark navbar — **no** user-selectable theme or layout mode today.

### 4.2 Data model (SQLite) — summary

Authoritative schema: `public/includes/config.php` (`initializeDatabase`); mirrored in **sanctumos/py-tasks** (`api_python/db.py`).

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `users`, `api_keys` | Auth and automation. |
| `task_statuses` | Customizable workflow slugs + `is_done`. |
| `tasks` | Core work item: title, body, status, due, priority, **project (string)**, tags JSON, rank, recurrence, assignee, creator, timestamps. |
| `task_comments` | Threaded discussion **per task** (not generic polymorphic). |
| `task_attachments` | Metadata + URL (not blob storage in DB). |
| `task_watchers` | Subscribers. |
| `audit_logs`, `login_attempts`, `api_rate_limits` | Ops/security. |

**API:** Documented in `docs/api.md` — list/get/create/update/delete, bulk, statuses, comments, attachments, watchers, taxonomy helpers (`list-projects`, `list-tags`), users, keys, session, audit.

## 5. Gap analysis — Basecamp 3 vs Sanctum Tasks

Legend: **Y** = good enough for a BC3-*style* presentation of that slice; **P** = partial / convention-only; **N** = missing for faithful BC3 semantics.

| Basecamp concept | Sanctum Tasks today | Overlay without schema change | Schema evolution (if faithful) |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Project as container | `tasks.project` is a **string label**, not an entity | Treat string as “project name”; group in UI | `projects` table + `project_id` FK |
| To-do list / groups | **N** — flat task list per filter | Fake “lists” as saved views or tags convention | `todo_lists`, optional `list_id` on tasks |
| To-do set / dock | **N** | N/A in data; UI could show fixed “tool: Tasks” | `project_tools` or embed in `projects` |
| Assignees (multiple) | **Single** `assigned_to_user_id` | Show one; “+N” disabled or flatten to watchers | `task_assignees` junction |
| Completed vs status | `task_statuses.is_done` + slug | Map “done” statuses to BC-style checkbox | Optional `completed_at` for clarity |
| Recording status (trashed/archived) | **N** — delete is destructive in UI/API | Soft-delete column + filter | `status` column `active|archived|trashed` |
| Schedule / calendar | `due_at` only | “Schedule” = due dates aggregation | `schedule_entries` or link-out |
| Message board | **N** | Link to external or defer | `messages` table or integration |
| Chat (Campfire) | **N** | Defer or embed Broca/chat URL | Separate service |
| Card table / Kanban | `rank` + `status` | **Kanban-style column = status** (reasonable MVP) | `kanban_columns` if decoupled from status |
| Hill Charts / gauges | **N** | Defer | New entities or integration |
| Watchers / subscriptions | `task_watchers` | Map to “who’s watching” | Optional notification prefs |
| Comments on anything | Comments **task-only** | OK for task-scoped overlay | Polymorphic `comments` if expanded |
| Files / vault | Attachment **metadata** | “Files” = task attachments list | Blob storage + `vaults` if first-class |
| Client visibility | **N** | N/A | ACL / `visibility` on projects |
| My assignments / home | API filters + UI | Dedicated “Me” dashboard route | Same + saved home layout prefs |
| Pings / global DM | **N** | Out of scope | Separate product |
| Search | `search-tasks.php` | BC-style omnibar **within tasks** | Cross-entity if more tables |

**Conclusion:** Sanctum Tasks already supports a **credible “Assignments + To-dos + basic project grouping”** slice of Basecamp. It does **not** support the full **recording + dock** model without substantial schema and API work.

## 6. Optional overlay — UX and technical approach

### 6.1 Product definition

- **Overlay** = alternate presentation layer (layouts, navigation, copy, density) that consumes the **same** JSON/API and session auth as today.
- **Optional** = per-user preference: default remains current Bootstrap admin unless the user enables a **Basecamp-style** layout (or similar label — see §9.2).
- **Install** = preference stored **per deployment user** after login (and optionally exposed as a query param for demos), not a separate npm “package” unless you later split front-end assets.

### 6.2 Suggested implementation shape (phased)

**Phase A — Preference + shell (low risk)**  
- Add `user_preferences` (or column on `users`): e.g. `ui_mode` enum `default|camp` (names TBD).  
- New PHP layout under `public/admin/` or parallel path `public/overlay/` that reuses `includes/auth.php` + task functions.  
- Toggle in navbar or profile menu; POST updates preference + CSRF.

**Phase B — BC3-flavored routes (still same data)**  
- **Home:** cards for “My open tasks”, “Due this week”, “By project” (aggregate `list-tasks` / `list-projects`).  
- **Project view:** `project=<name>` filter with list + optional Kanban by `status`.  
- **Task detail:** two-column layout (title/meta left, body/comments right) reminiscent of BC information hierarchy — still `view.php` logic.  
- **“Jump” palette:** client-side fuzzy search over recent projects/tasks (cached JSON).

**Phase C — Schema extensions (idempotent migrations)** — only when needed for fidelity  
- `projects` table + `project_id` on `tasks`.  
- `task_lists` + `list_id` (nullable).  
- `task_assignees` for multi-assignee.  
- `tasks.lifecycle_status` for trashed/archived vs workflow `status`.

Each phase should keep **API backward compatibility** (nullable FKs, defaults).

### 6.3 Visual and interaction notes

- Basecamp 3 emphasizes **low noise**, strong hierarchy, card-like **projects**, and **assignments-first** home. Sanctum can mimic **structure**, not pixel-perfect CSS, unless you want to invest in a dedicated design system.
- Respect licensing: do not copy proprietary **assets** (logos, art, lifted stylesheets); original layout and iconography. Naming may follow the Basecamp-inspired scheme (see §9.2).

### 6.4 Testing and verification

- Any new user-visible layout must follow workspace **design verification** rules: Playwright smoke + mobile and desktop screenshots, inspected before claiming visual completion.

### 6.5 Out of scope (unless explicitly greenlit)

- Full message boards, Campfire chat, Hill Charts, client portals, Pings, OAuth to real Basecamp, or feature parity with `bc3-api`’s entire section list.

## 7. Recommended milestones

1. **M1 — Preference + empty shell** — DB migration for `ui_mode`, toggle, route guard.  
2. **M2 — Home + project grouping** — aggregate queries only; no new tables.  
3. **M3 — Kanban by status** — drag-and-drop updates `status` / `rank` via existing APIs.  
4. **M4 — Schema: projects + lists** — idempotent SQL under `tools/migrations/` (per repo conventions).  
5. **M5 — Multi-assignee + soft delete** — API v2 considerations and mobile polish.

## 9. Resolved decisions (no longer blocking)

These were listed as open questions; defaults are fixed so implementation can proceed without another planning round.

### 9.1 Where the overlay lives

**Decision:** Ship **inside this repository** under `public/` (same deploy unit as today), implemented as additional PHP routes/layouts that reuse `includes/auth.php`, `includes/functions.php`, and existing APIs.

**Rationale:** Workspace web rules assume **application-level** delivery under `public/` without relying on separate nginx routes or a second deployable. A separate npm/Vite “static bundle” is **optional later** if you want a richer client (e.g. Kanban drag UX); if added, compiled assets still land under `public/` (e.g. `public/assets/overlay/`) and remain single-repo. **Do not** require a second origin or CDN as the default path.

### 9.2 Naming (product owner preference)

**Decision:** This repo is **free software** (AGPL). Mark is comfortable **adopting Basecamp-inspired naming** in docs, code, and UI where it helps users and contributors recognize the metaphor (e.g. “Basecamp-style layout”, `bc3_overlay`, “Hey-style” notifications menu, dock terminology in comments).

**Still do not:** copy **proprietary assets** (logos, artwork, exact CSS/markup lifted from Basecamp’s shipped product) or pass the work off as an official 37signals product. Prefer original assets and implementation; **names and UX vocabulary** that describe the pattern are fine for this project.

**Note:** Third-party trademarks remain their owners’ marks; this is a **practical open-source stance**, not legal advice. If you ever redistribute binaries or listings on stores that police naming, re-check their rules.

### 9.3 Multi-repo sync automation

**Decision:** **Optional script shipped in-repo** — see `tools/sync-sanctum-tasks-clones.sh`. It always syncs the repo it lives in; optionally pulls extra clone paths via `SANCTUM_TASKS_MIRROR_PATHS` (space-separated absolute paths). A full **sanctumos org** manifest across dozens of repos belongs in a **workspace-level** automation repo or dotfiles if you want one button for everything; that is out of scope for the tasks product itself.

---

## 10. Research gaps closed (post-plan verification)

| Gap | Resolution |
|-----|------------|
| **Workspace mirrors behind `main`** | After the planning commit, `/root/projects/sanctumos/sanctum-tasks` and `/root/projects/sanctum/sanctum-tasks` were **fast-forwarded** to the same `origin/main` as `/root/projects/sanctum-tasks`. Ongoing: run `tools/sync-sanctum-tasks-clones.sh` or `git pull` in each checkout you actually use. |
| **`bc3-api` repo title vs “Basecamp 3”** | Upstream README is branded generically (“The Basecamp API”) but examples use **`https://3.basecampapi.com/`**. The domain model (recordings, dock, todoset → list → todo) is the correct reference for a **“BC3-style”** mental model; version renumbering on GitHub does not change the integration surface for this plan. |
| **Who sees `ui_mode`?** | Overlay is **browser session / cookie** UX for humans using admin. **API-key clients** (agents, SDK) do not need layout mode; if a future SPA reads prefs, expose `ui_layout` (or equivalent) on **`GET /api/session-me.php`** and mirror it in **`py-tasks`** `session-me` for parity. |
| **Preference storage shape** | Prefer a single nullable column on **`users`**, e.g. `ui_layout TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default'`, constrained in app code to known values — simpler than a new `user_preferences` table for one enum. If many prefs appear later, migrate to `preferences_json` in an idempotent step. |
| **Authorization** | Overlay routes must call the **same** `requireAuth()` / role checks as current admin pages — no second permission model. |
| **Rich text vs `body`** | Sanctum `tasks.body` is plain text in practice; Basecamp messages use HTML rich text. Any “message board feel” in the overlay is **presentation-only** unless you scope a separate rich-text storage project. |
